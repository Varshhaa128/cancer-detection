Cancer Detection using Machine Learning
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting cancer based on [images/patient data]. Early and accurate detection of cancer plays a vital role in improving patient outcomes. By using algorithms like [specific model, e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNN), support vector machines (SVM)], the project classifies data into benign or malignant categories. The model is trained on [Dataset Name] to recognize patterns in the data, helping in the diagnosis process. This project demonstrates the application of AI in healthcare, providing an efficient method to assist medical professionals in cancer detection.
